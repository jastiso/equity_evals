## Equity in Perelman School of Medicine Evaluations

This project was diesigned to test for the presence of bias in evaluations against historically excluded groups in medicine. Here we focus on two narrow aspects of the perceived identity of a trainee: the gender and race/ethnicity.
We then test if the length, sentiment, and amount of gendered language used in evaluations.
